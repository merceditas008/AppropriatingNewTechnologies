\f0\fs24 \cf0 I was very interested in the lost sounds produced during the conversion of sound files to different formats. \
For this exercise I converted a sound file of one of my songs, originally in .wav format 44100, into .mp3 of quality 192 kbps, 160kbps and 128 kbps.\
I recorded the output of playing together the original file with each one of the mp3 versions with its phase inverted.\
In the sketch we can hear and see the different sound representations of them if we move the mouse above of the three buttons.}
